#!/usr/bin/env clj

; the above line lets the shell know what interpreter to use should
; you decide to make this file executable.

; since clojure can be interpreted via the `clj` command, no additional
; structure is required. just put in your solution, and run with:
; `clj fibonacci.clj <n>

(println "write your solution here!")
